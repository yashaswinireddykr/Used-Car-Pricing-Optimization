## Algorithm Selection & Methodology

### Data-Driven Model Selection
This project demonstrates sophisticated ML engineering through **empirical algorithm testing**. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, each brand was tested with multiple algorithms to determine optimal performance:

| Brand | Optimal Algorithm | Reasoning |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| **BMW** | Random Forest | Large, diverse dataset benefits from ensemble methods; complex feature interactions |
| **Toyota** | Random Forest | Diverse model lineup creates complex non-linear relationships |
| **Mercedes** | Decision Tree | Clear luxury feature hierarchies align with tree-based decisions |
| **Audi** | Decision Tree | Premium brand with interpretable feature-to-price relationships |
| **Vauxhall** | Decision Tree | Mid-range pricing with clear categorical dependencies |
| **Ford** | Decision Tree | Structured model lineup with hierarchical pricing |
| **Skoda** | Decision Tree | Value-oriented brand with straightforward price segments |
| **VW** | Decision Tree | Well-defined model tiers and pricing structure |
| **Hyundai** | Linear Regression | Simpler, more predictable linear pricing relationships |
